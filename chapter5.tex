\chapter{CONCLUSION}

\epigraph{If I seem to be over-interested in junk, it is because I am, and I have a lot of it, too --- half a garage full of bits and broken pieces. I use these things for repairing other things\ldots But it can be seen that I do have a genuine and almost miserly interest in worthless objects. My excuse is that in this era of planned obsolescence, when a thing breaks I can usually find something in my collection to repair it --- a toilet, or a motor, or a lawn mower. But I guess the truth is that I simply like junk.}{\hfill---John Steinbeck, \textit{Travels with Charley, 1962}}
